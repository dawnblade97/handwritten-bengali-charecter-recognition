# handwritten-bengali-charecter-recognition
 hii all,
 
 This is a repo on hand written bengali charecter recognition . I have used transfer learning on VGG16 model. Libraries used is maiinly keras and tensorflow.
 
 I have achieved 93% accuracy on the validation dataset with a 21% loss. In future much accuracy can be achieved by further fine tuning the code. The accuracy achieved is one of the highest using the dataset.
 
 future scope:
 
 1: make a ui for validation of the model using images from outside.
 2: accuracy can be further increased by fine tunung the optimizers as ell as the model.
 
 steps to use:
 1: download the dataset from https://www.dropbox.com/s/55bhfr3ycvsewsi/CMATERdb%203.1.2.rar
 2: unzip it in the directory you want
 3: modify the code for the directory
 4: train the model.
 
 MAIN STEP: install all the dependency for the code to work.
 
 1: Keras
 2: Tensorflow
 3: PILLOW
 
 System requirement:
 
 I have trained the following model on 
 
 AMD Ryzen 3 2240g
 NVIDIA gtx 750 ti as gpu
 
 you can install tensorflow gpu if you have a graphics card.
